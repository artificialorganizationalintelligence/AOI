# Organizational Semiotics

The theory of organisational semiotics is a key foundation for the methods and techniques which enable one to understand and articulate the business problem and its context under the study, to capture semantics and intentions of users in requirement models, and also to implement technical information systems that are flexi-ble and adaptable to the organisational change.

The research programme began in 1973, marked by Stamper’s book on information. It was first called LEGOL, which aimed to deliver a set of legally oriented techniques for requirements specification. It soon extended into a research effort into Methods for Eliciting, Analysing and Specifying Users’ Requirements (hence MEASUR). After several decades of development, the programme has further expanded into a set of methods to deal with all aspects of information systems.
